# TALC Jupyter enviornment
The Jupyter environment for the `TALC` cluster is located in the following: https://talc.ucalgary.ca:8000/hub/login. The link could be accessed using a standard web browser. You may use your UC username and password to login (use only the part before the `@` in `someone@ucalgary.ca`).

Before using Jupyter for the first time, please make sure you login to the `TALC` cluster first, using:
```console
$ ssh your-UC-user-name@talc.ucalgary.ca
```
And use your UC password to login. After logging in, you have to accept the Terms of Use with the cluster.

> [!CAUTION]
> Only after accepting the Terms of Use (TOU), you can login to TALC's Jupyter enviornment using your UC username and password.

> [!NOTE]
> Please be mindful that Assignment #3 Jupyter Notebooks may ask you to choose an appropriate kernel upon launching. Please choose the relavant Kernel if such a prompt shows up.
