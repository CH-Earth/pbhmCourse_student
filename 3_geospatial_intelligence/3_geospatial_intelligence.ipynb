In this homework, we are going to dive deeper into how spatial configurations for SUMMA can actually be assembled from environmental data.

Throughout this exercise you will learn how to:\n",

If you are running this outside that platform (i.e., a personal laptop) you will need to install a local copy of geospatialtools (among other libraries). To do that you will need to run the following command at the terminal `pip install \"git+https://github.com/chaneyn/geospatialtools.git@dev_nate”`.
